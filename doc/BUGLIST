  bug: bep_2015-5
  When printing the payslip address, phone, fax, companywebsite are not printed.

  bug: bep_201504-4 - fixed 2015/4/23
  Workstation transaction. Can't enter printer command with '='; everything after the sign get's cut off.
  Reason: printer option is stored in DB like: BRN2270=lpr -PPRN2270 "-o sides=one-sided fitplot"
  When the option is read the line is split at the '=' sign - which means that everything after "...sides" is lost
  Workaround: put print commands in a bash script and enter the script name (incl. path) as print command into Ledger

  bug: bep_201504-3
  Exempt deductions are not included in the gross wage. "Exempt" means that these amounts are not included
  in the calculation of deductions. (Deduction) exempted wage types will still be paid to the employee.

  1 wage type, income tax (deduction), fixed income tax amounts based on the yealy salary, several tax brackets.
  Wage is deferred.
  Income tax is calculated correctly. If, however, the "Update" button is pressed afterwards the income tax calculation
  comes to a different(lower) result.

  bug: bep_201502-04
  Cannot retrieve previously entered time cards. Affected programs: jc.pl and JC.pm
  The code of jc.pl includes a new form type "storecard". It seems that the programs contain some new code
  not activated yet.
  Not a bug: employee id had changed, program shows only timecards for active employees
  Storecard is a new (inactive) function

  If a rate is entered in a deduction record the deduction amount is calculated by applying the rate to the wage.
  Using the “Based On” field we can calculate the amount with respect to another deduction. In this case
  only a rate can be entered. Additional error message specified

  Payroll: entries in the amount column are ignored. If a deduction can only be defined in percentage terms
           this is a serious restriction because not all deductions are defined this way

  bug: bep_201411-05 git
* When creating a vendor invoice for a purchase order the payment method is copied from the vendor master record.
  However, when saving the invoice the payment method is not stored in the AP record. When editing the invoice
  the corrected payment method and account (e.g. bank transfer) are not copied to the AP record.

bp 2014/11/22
  bug: bep_201411-04
* Additional payment record if payment is entered with new payment method
  If you enter payment data for a vendor invoice and change/select a payment method and don't press update but post
  the program will create an addition AP transaction record and 2 payments - 1 for the original invoice and 1 for
  the new AP transaction. (screenshots erp-add-payment-record-bug-img1.png, erp-add-payment-record-bug-img2.png)
  Analysis:
  PO Invoices are stored in table AP. Data is kept in 1 record. The last field of the record holds the id of the
  paymentmethod (e.g. bank transfer). Therefore you cannot have 2 payments with different payment methods for the
  same invoice. Data check required before the payment is accepted for posting, throw error if we already have a
  partial payment with a different or empty payment method. The payment also seems to update paymentmethod and
  bank_id (chart_id) in the AP record.
  Solution:
  The bug originates in rounding problems with cash discount.
  SQL-Ledger records a foreign currency payment by splitting it into 2 parts. First part is the amount entered and
  the second part is (amount entered x exchange rate) - amount entered.
  Example:
    payment is 143.19 USD, exchange rate USD to JPY is 103.32 JPY/USD
    1: part 1: 143.19
    2: part 2: 14650.81 Jpy
    3: Total : 14794.39 Jpy -> rounded to 14794
    Problem is that we can't record fractions of Yen in the accounting ledger.
  Why is SQL-Ledger recording the figures this way? It uses these postings together with the ID field in table
  acc_trans to identify the partial payments. If you edit the Vendor Invoice you see all payments listed by their
  id number and the "part 1 amount".
  The same happens if we get a vendor cash discount for early payment. The discount in foreign currency is entered
  in table acc_trans with an exchange rate of 1, then a second line is added and the two lines together hold the
  discount amount in Jpy.
  This really means that it is impossible to record foreign currency payments with decimals correctly. If we round
  to full Yen amounts we can't record and show the actually paid amounts and the cash discount.
  To solve this we add a field 'amount' to the payment record.
  The payment record currently holds the trans_id, the exchange rate and the paymentmethod id. Records are indexed by
  an id, thus we can have several payment records for one (invoice) transaction.
  In the new amount colum we record the payment amount in the invoice/payment currency. The paymentmethod field may
  have a 0 value. Cash discounts are entered with an exchange rate of 1 (these discounts are always in the vendor's
  currency) and with the chart-id in the paymentmethod field (acc_trans-chart_id=payment-paymentmethod_id).
  The same logic needs to be applied to customer invoices as well!
  In order to be able to properly convert item values in foreign currency to the home currency we have added a
  'fxamount' column to table acc_trans.
  Compatibility/Migration
  If the user wants to look up old foreign currency document the system recognizes that the new fields don't contain
  any information and uses the old logic. When saving data is stored using the new logic (because the program deletes
  a changed document and then saves it again.) For all new foreign currency documents the new logic will be used!

* Partslist doesn't show maxpricedecimals
  If a part has sellprice, list price, last cost or avg costs smaller than 1 currency unit and you have specified
  the maxpricedecimals default with a higher precision then the prices should be shown with the maxpricedecimals
  precision.
