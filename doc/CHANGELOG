  If a rate is entered in a deduction record the deduction amount is calculated by applying the rate to the wage.
  Using the “Based On” field we can calculate the amount with respect to another deduction. In this case
  only a rate can be entered. Additional error message specified

  Employee pays, employer pays.
  Percentage values like 0.4 are required. This is confusing because in the rate column percent are
  entered like 30%. Change to percent input

* When creating a vendor invoice for a purchase order the payment method is copied from the vendor master record.
* However, when saving the invoice the payment method is not stored in the AP record. When editing the invoice
* the corrected payment method and account (e.g. bank transfer) are not copied to the AP record.
  This happens because the "amount" field below the date/currency filed is empty. When pressing "update" the
  line item amounts are added and entered into the "amount" field.
  Problem solved by checking the "amount" field and displaying a message if the field is empty.

* Purchase transaction list shows transaction in foreign currency without decimals
  Amounts in foreign currency are showing if the currency field has been selected. Values are now showing with the
  precision for their currency. Subtotal calculation has also been corrected. All foreign currency subtotals are
  showing if the list is sorted by currency.
  Amountsin home currency are NOT shown in the foreign currency columns anymore.
  Added missing subtotals (netamount and tax).
  Totals for foreign currency are NOT shown anymore - if we have two or more currencies it doesn't make sense calculate
  a total of different currencies.

# bp 2014.11.25
new feature
* calculate and store high precision exchange rate to avoid differences between invoice and payment amounts
   Converting between currencies is getting difficult if (a) one currency doesn't have decimals (Japanese Yen)
   and (b) the conversion rates are high. Exchange rates with 1 or 2 decimals are not sufficient to correctly
   convert back from Jpy to Euro or Dollar.
   To solve this problem we calculate the exchange rate by dividing the amount in local currency by the amount
   in document currency. Instead of the exchange rate entered we store the calculated exchange rate with
   5 decimals in the ap table

new feature/bugfix bug bep_201411-05
   receipt/payment screen: when one customer/vendor has been selected update the screens business type
   and payment method to the customer/vendors business type and payment method
   Reason: vendor has payment method 'bank transfer'. If we post a payment this payment type should be selected
   by default. Currently no payment method is selected and - unless the user selects it manually - the payment
   is recorded with an empty payment method (in the payment table)
   Added business type data retrieval to AA.pm get_name function, set vendor/customer fields in cp.pl

# bp 2014.11.22
bugfix/new feature bug bep_201411-04

# bp 2014.11.17
new feature
* format_amount dash option
    Added a new dash option 'SZ' to suppress trailing zeroes when formatting amounts. Thisi s used to show
    lastcost, sellprice and vendor/customer maxtrix prices only up to the detail entered - i.e. not always
    up to the Max Price Decimals precision.

new feature
*  solved price matrix bug:
    The precision of prices entered into the vendor price matrix is limited to the number of decimals found
    in the last cost field of the part.
    The precision of customer prices entered into the customer price matrix is limited to the number of decimals
    found in the sell price field of the part.
    Japanese Yen don't have decimals and therefore sellprice, lastcost are with 0 decimals. If you want to enter
    a Euro, Pound, Dollar price with cents/pennies in the price matrix you have to add decimals to the lastcost
    before you can enter a customer/vendor price with cents/pennies.
    This is a kludge and users won't understand it without additional explanation.
  new feature
    New default variable: Max Price Decimals
    This variable determines the max number of decimals a last cost/selling price may have. If not specified the value
    is automatically set to '2' - which is the precision of (almost) all currencies. The value cannot be smaller than
    the precision of the home currency.

  when entering a purchase order without pickup requirement the message "order date missing" was displayed.
  Corrected to show correct message "Pickup date missing" when transport data has been entered

# bp 2014.11.12 bplagge@choicenet.ne.jp
new feature
* added function to lookup the exchange rate for foreign currency sales and purchase orders.
  an additional button is placed next to the exchange rate field. If pressed the current exchange rate is
  entered into the exchange rate field.
  Lookup program and the exchange rate precision are defined in the sql-ledger-sys.conf file.
  Variables: $get_exrate_prog, $exrate_rounding
  The lookup program requires the perl Finance::Quote module
  This function is available for:
  Sales: Add Transaction, Sales Invoice, Credit Note, Credit Invoice,
  Purchases: Add Transaction, Vendor Invoice, Debit Note, Debit Invoice,
  Order Entry: Sales Order, Puchase Order
  Quotations: Quotation, RFQ
  General Ledger: Add Transaction

* login didn't work
  moved password unpack line before the db_init statement

* include of tex templates didn't work
  corrected template directory path to include the dbname and minor code fix

* display and edit of template files not working
  corrected template directory path to include the dbname

* printing of ps/pdf files from queue not working, html template was printed (looks like bug in SQL-Ledger)
  retrieve spool files, don't run parse_template, send files to printer, remove spool files, update status
  (pdf files are converted to ps using pdftops)

* could not print orders, invoices from the 'add order', 'change order' screens
  - $latex = 0 was set
  - the "selectprinter" routine was disabled in the program code
  * added enable_selectprinter variable via include file sql-ledger-sys.conf

* couldn't create ps files from tex templates
  - $latex = 0 was set in all main .pl program
  - the lighttpd web server (I'm using) does not preserve environment variables
  * added the $ENV['PATH'] via include file sql-ledger-sys.conf

new feature
* sql-ledger-sys.conf
  - the main configuration file sql-ledger.conf is created by SQL-Ledger. Some of the system related variables
    have been moved to the main *.pl files like $sendmail, $latex, $printer, $ENV
    However, some variables are system dependent ($sendmail, $gzip, $latex, $ENV). Printing from a hosting/cloud
    environment to a (remote) customer printer is possible but not easy to set up. It is easier to use pdf files,
    call a pdf reader and print/save the data.
    But if we are in a networking environment direct printing is the easiest solution.

  - For these reasons I defined and included a new system configuration file where the system administrator can
    define the required variables for the system environment. This is easy and requires only few code changes.

* carp debugging
  added an inactive carp debugging include file. If enabled carp debugging lines can be added to the code which
  is a great help when debugging the code.
